<!--

    1. I linked my css and js files to my html 

    2. I added: header, nav, main, and footer. I then made a <h1> to label my page 

    3. in my nav I created labels and inputs for my check boxes and for my submit button.

    originally I seperated the inputs and the label but I was told it is good practince to keep them togeather... 
    (I put them togeather once I had my code looked over. I didnt really see a difference I just had to make sure
    that they where in the right order because it kept putting the label and then the check box.)

    4. I added a footer and made it say Wisdo world because why not. 

    5. I added a small "what to do" <p> because some people dont understand things. So its more user friendly
    in my opinion to mave it specify what is expected

    6. I created a div for resturants to make sure that I was able to have an area for the resturants to pop
